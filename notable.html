        <p id="description-proxima" class="description">Discovered in 2016, Proxima Centauri b is the closest known exoplanet to Earth, orbiting the star Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our Sun. It lies within the habitable zone and could have conditions suitable for liquid water. Its proximity makes it a prime candidate for further study. Understanding this exoplanet could provide insights into the potential for life beyond our solar system.</p>
